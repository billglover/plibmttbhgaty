# plibmttbhgaty

I spent a couple of hours at the first London [#PLIBMTTBHGATY](http://plibmttbhgaty.com) event. I'd settled on [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) as my language of choice for three key reasons:

 - I'd never seen any Clojure code before
 - Functional programming
 - Clojure is actively used today

In the time available, we managed to get fizzBuzz working. It may not seem like much, but I'd forgotten what it was like to tackle something completely new.

## Usage

    $ java -jar target/uberjar/plibmttbhgaty-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

## Examples

Sample output is shown below.

```

### Leasons

Part of me is frustrated that I hadn't read up on Clojure beforehand as much of the challenge was in the familiarisation with the environment, the syntax and the basics.

Things I learned:

 - spend a bit of time setting up your editor
 - familiarise yourself with the syntax (it's more than just brackets)
 - use the REPL for getting started
 - beware lazy sequences, they may be so lazy they don't do anything
